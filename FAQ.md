# FAQ

## What happens if I lose my device?

Your data is unrecoverable unless you exported an encrypted archive. This is the cost of zero-knowledge storage.

---

## Can you access my photos?

No. There are no servers, accounts, or recovery systems. Keys never leave your device.

---

## Does the app use the internet?

No. Nu11VLT has no network functionality.

---

## What if I forget my PIN?

Your vault is permanently inaccessible. There is no recovery mechanism by design.

---

## Is FaceID safe?

FaceID uses the Secure Enclave. It improves convenience but can be coerced. High-risk users should prefer PIN-only unlock.

---

## User Recommendations

- Keep iOS updated
- Never jailbreak your device
- Use longer PINs
- Enable auto-lock
- Use encrypted exports if data matters
- Treat Backup PIN as a risk-reduction tool, not a guarantee

---

## Final Note

Nu11VLT reduces digital risk. It cannot eliminate physical, legal, or operational risk. No consumer application can.
